# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Real-Time Competency Scoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create LLM-based evaluation system that scores responses against predefined competencies on a 0-10 scale.
# Details:
1. Design prompt templates for LLM-based scoring against competencies
2. Implement scoring logic for each answer on 0-10 scale
3. Create weighted aggregation of scores across competencies
4. Store scoring data with interview responses
5. Implement calibration mechanisms to ensure scoring consistency
6. Add confidence metrics for scores generated

# Test Strategy:
Compare LLM-generated scores with expert human evaluations on sample responses to verify >85% agreement. Test scoring consistency across similar responses.
