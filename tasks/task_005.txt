# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement RAG for Domain Knowledge Retrieval
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop retrieval-augmented generation capabilities to inform question generation and answer evaluation.
# Details:
1. Implement vector similarity search using ChromaDB
2. Create prompt templates that incorporate retrieved context
3. Develop relevance filtering for retrieved documents
4. Implement caching for frequently accessed knowledge
5. Create fallback strategies when relevant documents aren't found
6. Optimize retrieval for clinical terminology and concepts

# Test Strategy:
Test retrieval with clinical queries and verify >90% of retrieved documents are relevant to the question context. Measure retrieval latency and optimize if needed.
