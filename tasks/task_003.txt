# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Document Processing Pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality for uploading, chunking, and embedding clinical documents into the knowledge base.
# Details:
1. Implement document upload interface
2. Create document chunking logic (consider optimal chunk size for RAG)
3. Process documents through the embedding pipeline
4. Store chunks and embeddings in ChromaDB
5. Implement document management features (list, delete, update)
6. Add validation for document types and formats

# Test Strategy:
Upload various clinical document formats and verify proper chunking, embedding, and storage. Test with documents of different sizes up to the 20MB limit.
